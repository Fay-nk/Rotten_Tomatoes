# Rotten_Tomatoes

I did make 4 dashbooards and each one is a different project


# First project: 🎬 Movie Performance Overview Dashboard

📊 **Power BI Dashboard | Rotten Tomatoes Dataset | Data Analysis & Visualization Project**

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

In the fast-paced film and streaming industry, stakeholders often lack a centralized view of how their movie catalog is performing. This dashboard solves the question:

> **“How are our movies performing in terms of quality, audience ratings, and critical reception — and where should we focus improvement or promotion?”**

---

## 🔍 Project Goals

* Understand the **distribution of movies** by critic rating (Tomatometer Status).
* Identify **top-performing titles** based on critic score.
* Visualize **runtime trends**, audience engagement, and studio/genre performance.
* Provide stakeholders (e.g., marketers, executives, product teams) with an **interactive and actionable overview**.
